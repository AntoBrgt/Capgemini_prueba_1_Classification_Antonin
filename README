# Description

The dataset describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on it's quality. It comes from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset.

I've choosen this dataset because Spain and France are both wine's countries. 
Also, there is 10 class of wine here that I find enough to show you how I work.

This data frame contains the following columns:

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):\
1 - fixed acidity\
2 - volatile acidity\
3 - citric acid\
4 - residual sugar\
5 - chlorides\
6 - free sulfur dioxide\
7 - total sulfur dioxide\
8 - density\
9 - pH\
10 - sulphates\
11 - alcohol\
Output variable (based on sensory data):\
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

This dataset is also available from Kaggle & UCI machine learning repository,

# Objective:

Build classification models to predict the wine quality.

Add all files to put it in production.

# How to use

First of all, run the preparation_model.py inside the production folder. Then a model is going to be made. Then run the containerize.py file to build the docker image and run it.

Then run the file deploy_model to see if everything's good and then run the test_api.py to see the prediction. For the test I've written, the result is 6.

Then running the containerize.py, you can build the docker image to run the model.
You can run the setup_monitoring.py too open Prometheus for the monitoring but to be honest I've never used it.

Run the update_and_maintenance.py script to pull any modification from the git.

# What's next ?

I can add a file to add in the csv file more datas and then train the model again with these new datas. We can also improve the flask API in a true app.
